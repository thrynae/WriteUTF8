While it is fairly easy on new releases of Matlab to write UTF-8 files, older releases tend to have some difficulties creating such files.

This function facilitates writing text and accepts inputs encoded as text (`char`/`cellstr`/`string`), as well as in a binary format (either UTF-32 or UTF-8).
